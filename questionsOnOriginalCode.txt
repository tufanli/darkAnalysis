Questions:

Meson.cxx:
1- if((iE*iE)>(fM*fM)) why square ??
2- do we assume c=1, so E2=m2+p2 ??

VB.cxx:
1- com = meson_lf + zero_m; ??? at the end of this boost 
2- meson_cmf has already been defined at line 205 but redefined at 234?? may generate unpredicted behaviour. Line 236 might be dengerous.
3- Is it decay in Flight? using CM frame variables...
4- Line 264 ?? why just describe new and same objects ??
